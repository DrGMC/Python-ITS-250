# This program calculates the sum of a series
# of numbers entered by the user.

# Initialize an accumulator variable.

##When the loop finishes, the accumulator will contain the total of the numbers that were
##read by the loop. Notice that the first step in the flowchart is to set the accumulator variable to 0.
##This is a critical step. Each time the loop reads a number, it adds it to the accumulator.
##If the accumulator starts with any value other than 0, it will not contain the correct total
##when the loop finishes.
